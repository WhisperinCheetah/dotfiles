# Dotfiles

This is a directory for my dotfiles. It can be used with GNU stow if everything is in the correct location.

> Before running these commands, make sure to backup your dotfiles! Take a look inside to see what you should backup.

```sh
cd $HOME
git clone git@github.com:WhisperinCheetah/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
stow .
```
